Thanks for installing the source code of my really crappy NFT Generator,

please use this for something more useful 
You can do literally whatever you want with this BUT making NFT's :) If you want feel free to credit.


//IMPORTANT//

Drag the main folder into a point where you want the code to be and open the .yyp in GameMaker Studio 2 version 2022.3 or later. (could run in earlier maybe havent tested), then drag then go to your appdata\roaming folder location and create a folder dubbed 'nftgen', inside drag the inputs folder out from the obviously not meant to be here folder into the nftgen folder. 

That inputs folder has each category and piece of the image within it. The way the application figures out how many different items is sudo hard coded. Easy to edit it within code though. I did make this within ~2 days (estimated up), so I might make an updated version that adds a proper GUI, but I dont wanna waste my time with this crap lol.
